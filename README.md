This repo contains the code for lab rotation conducted as a part of BCCN masters course curriculum. 

This project is a reproduction of the publication "Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitation in the face of plasticity" by L.B. Naumann and H.Sprekeler       [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.944082v1.full.pdf]. 


Rate model simulation described in the paper are replicated in this repo. 

The link to source code by author of the publication (including rate model and spiking model) can be found here: https://github.com/sprekelerlab/code_stabilisation_Naumann20
